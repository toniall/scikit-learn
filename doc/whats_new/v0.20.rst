Version 0.20 (under development)
================================

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` in Python 2 (bug fix)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

New features
............

Classifiers and regressors

- :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` now support early stopping
  via ``n_iter_no_change``, ``validation_fraction`` and ``tol``. :issue:`7071`
  by `Raghav RV`_

- Added :class:`naive_bayes.ComplementNB`, which implements the Complement
  Naive Bayes classifier described in Rennie et al. (2003).
  By :user:`Michael A. Alcorn <airalcorn2>`.

Enhancements
............

Classifiers and regressors

- In :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, method ``predict``
  is faster when using ``return_std=True`` in particular more when called
  several times in a row. :issue:`9234` by :user:`andrewww <andrewww>`
  and :user:`Minghui Liu <minghui-liu>`.

- Add `named_estimators_` parameter in
  :class:`sklearn.ensemble.voting_classifier` to access fitted
  estimators. :issue:`9157` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`.


Model evaluation and meta-estimators

- A scorer based on :func:`metrics.brier_score_loss` is also available.
  :issue:`9521` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Bug fixes
.........

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

- Fix for uninformative error in :class:`decomposition.incremental_pca`:
  now an error is raised if the number of components is larger than the
  chosen batch size. The ``n_components=None`` case was adapted accordingly.
  :issue:`6452`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``partial_fit`` method of
  :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` used integer division instead of float
  division on Python 2 versions. :issue:`9492` by
  :user:`James Bourbeau <jrbourbeau>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``fit`` method of
  :class:`cluster.affinity_propagation_.AffinityPropagation` stored cluster
  centers as 3d array instead of 2d array in case of non-convergence. For the
  same class, fixed undefined and arbitrary behavior in case of training data
  where all samples had equal similarity.
  :issue:`9612`. By :user:`Jonatan Samoocha <jsamoocha>`.

  underlying implementation is not random.
